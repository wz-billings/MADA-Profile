# My website and data analysis portfolio

This is where I keep my MADA 2021 portfolio website code. You can see the website at [this link](https://wzbillings.github.io/ZaneBillings-MADA-portfolio/)!

Part of the CSS isn't working but it doesn't bother me enough to debug.

Feel free to contact me about my website at:
wesley DOT billings AT uga DOT edu

or send me a slack message through the course slack!
